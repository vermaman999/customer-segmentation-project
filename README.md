# customer-segmentation-project
Segment Amex customers into groups (e.g., high-spenders, low-risk) using K-Means clustering, and create an interactive Plotly dashboard.

Lets say, credit Card wants to send special offers (like cashback or travel rewards) to their credit card customers, but they don’t want to send the same offer to everyone. This project helps figure out different types of customers (e.g., big spenders, cautious savers) so they can send the right offers to the right people. It’s like sorting your friends into groups (party lovers, book nerds) to invite them to events they’ll like.
